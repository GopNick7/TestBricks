# TestBricks
Testing task

· Testing task is to write a program according to the specification below.
· All that and the source code of the program and everything needed to check it is to be sent by mail to
us before the time specified separately.
· Additionally, it is needed to write a report for that task. The documentation should specify which
environment was used to develop the program.
· It is recommended to respect the specified requirements of the task. Every mismatch to the
requirements should be proved. Pay attention to the style of coding and documentation. And, the main
requirement is that the program must work correctly on various possible input data.

1 there is an example of wall configuration on the left side and a set of bricks on the right: 4 bricks of length 1,
6 bricks of length 2 and 1 brick of length 3.

· The configuration of wall is not limited: it can break into several parts, can seem unstable, can have
holes, etc.
· As you can see from Fig 1, the wall in figure 1 can be built using the specified set of bricks. One variant
of doing that is shown.
· The description of wall and bricks is custom enter programmatically in Edit Text. The result of
verification is printed to Text View, either "yes" (wall can be constructed) or "no" (wall cannot be
constructed). Each brick has the rectangular form.
· Example of program output: yes
